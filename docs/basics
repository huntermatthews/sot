Fooling Around

Should it be "kgb" or "platform" ??
Python or bash?
  windows has bash...

COMMAND LINES
>kgb 
[[HELP]]

> kgb hwid       (can be symlinked to 'hwid')
APL.12345

> kgb whatami    (can be symlinked to 'whatami')
darwin-10.11-x86_64


THINGS IT SHOULD DO
whatami - take over from the old whatami program (rename it platform?)
hwid - do what we have to do to figure out the manufacturer and serial number
